# mybashrc
My BashRC

This is my BashRC file I use for almost every ubuntu machine.
It works fine on most distros that are based on debian and use the apt package manager.

## Installation

To install mybashrc, please enter your home folder and type this command:

    source <(curl -S https://9hax.github.io/9haxify.bash)

This clones the repository and copies the files to your homefolder and cleans up the installation files after.
